## About

The goal of this repository is to provide a publicly accessible database with information collected by Cockatoo. The data is automatically updated and may serve as a resource for research, analysis, or educational purposes.

**Note:** While no sensitive information should be present in this dump, if you discover anything potentially dangerous (e.g., links containing plaintext JWTs), please [open an issue](https://github.com/DominicTWHV/CTI-DB-Dump/issues) so it can be promptly investigated and resolved. If you do not wish to make an issue, a post under Security also works.

See `metadata.json` for more information.
